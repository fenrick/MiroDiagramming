Error messages help you understand what went wrong, where, and why. They give you context to make it easier to troubleshoot issues. This is a reference overview of error messages that the Miro Web SDK can throw to notify about a failed operation. Error messages are grouped in sections: Authorization Error notifications ranging from missing permissions, to users rejecting to grant the required permissions to an app during the installation, to users lacking authorization to interact with apps or boards. Installation Error notifications about issues occurring when installing an app to the board. Initialization Error notifications about failed initialization of the Web SDK, of the instance of an item, and so on. They can occur when a command initiates an action on an object that isn&#x27;t yet available on the board. User interface Error notifications about a failed interaction with a UI component of the board. For example: the board UI may be unresponsive, or the app may attempt to interact with an element that isn&#x27;t associated with the ID of the app. CRUD operations Error notifications about failed attempts to create, read, update, or delete a board item or a resource. Invalid input Error notifications about failed operations because of passing invalid arguments. For example: incomplete, malformed, or outside the range of the expected values. Rate limiting Errors notifications about your app using up allocated resources too quickly. Check how you can mitigate the issue by reducing the number of calls per minute or per hour. Backend Error notifications about failed data exchange with the server. Unknown ID Errors notifications about messing IDs to identify a board item or an app. If the Miro Web SDK attempts to perform an action on, or exchange data with an item or an app, it identifies the target object by its unique ID. If the ID reference isn&#x27;t valid, or if it&#x27;s not found, the operation fails. Unsupported Errors notifications about performing actions that aren&#x27;t supported. For example: actions that don&#x27;t comply with existing constraints, or that aren&#x27;t available. Unknown error In this case, the error message includes the original payload to provide a starting point for troubleshooting . Authorization Error message Description The authorization request failed, or the user rejected it. The end user didn&#x27;t complete installing the app to the board when prompted through the UI. Or: the app wasn&#x27;t granted the required permissions. Or: the app authorization information is invalid. Cannot execute ${command}, because the ${appId} app doesn&#x27;t have the following permission: ${requiredScope}. The app wasn&#x27;t granted a permission that enables executing the specified command. For example: Commands that access board items require boards:read Commands that modify board items require boards:write Commands that start and stop audio recording require microphone:listen The user doesn&#x27;t have the necessary permissions in the team to obtain an ID token. The user trying to access the app lacks one or more required permissions that the app needs to work as expected. The user doesn&#x27;t have the necessary permissions to hide content in frames. The showContent property of frame items requires permissions that are available to board owners and co-owners on a Consultant or Enterprise plan. The user is unauthorized in Miro. Only authorized users can obtain ID tokens. The user trying to access the app hasn&#x27;t been authorized as a Miro user. The (${name}) feature is available only on paid plans. To use this feature, upgrade your current plan to a paid one. The feature that you&#x27;re trying to use isn&#x27;t available on your current plan. Upgrade to a paid plan to access it. The current user doesn&#x27;t have enough permissions to access the feature ${feature}. The feature requires additional permissions that the current user hasn&#x27;t been granted. The user needs to first request the additional permissions, and then they can access the feature. Installation Error message Description The &quot;${appName}&quot; app (${appId}) isn&#x27;t installed for the &quot;${teamName}&quot; team. To use the app with this team, install it for them. The currently selected team cannot access the app. Install it for the team to make it available. Initialization Error message Description The Web SDK hasn&#x27;t initialized. The Miro Web SDK hasn&#x27;t initialized on the board, and it&#x27;s not available. The item instance hasn&#x27;t initialized. The app attempted to interact with the instance of an item that hasn&#x27;t initialized on the board, and that&#x27;s not available. The drag state hasn&#x27;t initialized. The app attempted to drag a board item. However, the drag state hasn&#x27;t initialized on the board, and it&#x27;s not available. Cannot execute the command, because the app iframe hasn&#x27;t initialized. The iframe that the app controls hasn&#x27;t initialized on the board, and it&#x27;s not available. Cannot open the modal or the panel, because no iframe is registered with the ${type}. The app attempted to open an iframe to display a modal or a panel. However, no iframe is registered to interact with the app and the Miro Web SDK 2.0. Cannot load the app, because the method to load it is called on a destroyed app instance. It wasn&#x27;t possible to load and start the app, because the app instance no longer exists. User interface Error message Description The app is trying to close a modal, but there&#x27;s no open modal associated with this app. Either the app attempted to close a modal that the app cannot interact with. Or there are currently no open modals that the app can close. The modals that an app can interact with must be registered with the app. The app is trying to close a panel, but there&#x27;s no open panel associated with this app. Either the app attempted to close a panel that the app cannot interact with. Or there are currently no open panels that the app can close. The panels that an app can interact with must be registered with the app. Cannot open the panel. The board GUI may be inactive or hidden. Since the board UI is inactive or hidden, the panel toolbar is not available. Therefore, it&#x27;s not possible to trigger opening a panel. You can drag on the board only items from panels that are opened with the &#x27;openPanel&#x27; method. Apps must open a panel with the openPanel method. Draggable items can be included only in panels opened with openPanel . CRUD operations Error message Description Cannot set item ${id} as a child, because the item isn&#x27;t inside the parent frame. The app attempted to set an item as a child of a parent frame. However, the item the ID refers to isn&#x27;t inside the target frame. Therefore, it cannot be a child of the frame. Cannot set item ${id} as a child, because the item doesn&#x27;t exist. The app attempted to set an item as a child of a parent frame. However, the item the ID refers to doesn&#x27;t exist on the board. Cannot move the ${type} item with ID (${id}) to the specified location, because it&#x27;s a child of another board item. Remove the child item from its parent, and then move it. The app attempted to move an item to a new position on the board. The operation failed, because the item is a child of a parent item. First, remove the child item from its parent. Then, the app can set new coordinates for the item, and sync it to update its position on the board. Cannot create the image. The app attempted to create an image item, but it failed to correctly retrieve the image the URL points to . Cannot upload the image: ${msg}. The app attempted to update an image item, but it failed to correctly retrieve the updated image the URL points to . Cannot change this property, because it&#x27;s read-only: &quot;${prop}&quot; The app attempted to update a property that is available with read-only access. Cannot remove the ${type} item (id=${id}). The app attempted to remove a board item, but the item the ID refers to may not exist on the board, or it may not be possible to retrieve it. The title must be unique. Specify a different title for the tag. The title that the app attempted to assign to a tag already exists. Cannot create more tags. The board has reached the limit of ${limit} tags. It&#x27;s not possible to have more than 100 tags in total on a board . The canvas API returned an unknown color: ${color}. The backend returned a color name for the tag that isn&#x27;t included in the list of allowed tag colors . Cannot resolve the embed URL ${url}. Please try again later. It&#x27;s not possible to correctly resolve the URL pointing to the content of an embed item. This may be a temporary issue. Retry the operation at a later time. Cannot change parent, because item ${id} is locked by another client. The app attempted to update a frame containing one or more child items. At the same time, a different user accessed a child item to modify it. When the user finishes editing the child item, it is unlocked. Then it&#x27;s possible to update the parent frame. Cannot commit the update, because item ${id} is locked by another client. The app attempted to update an item. At the same time, a different user accessed the same item to modify it. When the user finishes editing the item, it is unlocked. Then it&#x27;s possible to update it. The data storage limit for &quot;${featureName}&quot; has been exceeded. The app attempted to store more metadata than the allowed limit to either appdata or item metadata . For more information, see setAppData and setMetadata Cannot attach a locked item to a parent, because another client is locking item ${id}. You&#x27;re trying to attach an item to a parent.
