Consolidated help cache (markdown-only)

- This folder previously stored large HTML/TXT snapshots of the Miro Developer docs for offline reference.
- We consolidated on lightweight markdown notes to avoid bulk diffs and repo bloat.

What remains

- `shape-experimental-report.md` â€” curated notes around experimental shape APIs.

Where to look

- Web SDK quick references live in `docs/cache/miro-websdk/*.md`.
- For full docs, use the live site: https://developers.miro.com/
