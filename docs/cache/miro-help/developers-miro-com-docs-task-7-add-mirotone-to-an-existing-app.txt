Progress: 80% Time to complete ~8 minutes Learning objective After completing this onboarding task, you’ll be able to: Explore the Mirotone library, and Efficiently design high-quality apps by leveraging our pre-built components in the Miro style. No app is complete without some design thought ! Take some time to explore our Mirotone library and add some components to your app. Action: add Mirotone to your app Using the drag and drop app you cloned earlier (or a new app), add Mirotone by navigating to the root directory of the app and running npm install mirotone : Shell cd path-to/&lt;your-app&gt;/root-dir npm install mirotone Next, add a new heading to the app to give it some structure. 💡 You can find this in the Foundation section on mirotone.xyz . Once you&#x27;ve added a new heading, add a second component to the app—a checkbox. 💡 You can find this in the Components section on mirotone.xyz . Let&#x27;s wrap up In this onboarding task, you: Explored the Mirotone library, and Added a couple of Mirotone components to the app. You&#x27;ve come a long way ! Let&#x27;s wrap up. 📘 Recommended in-depth training Now that you&#x27;ve completed tasks 5-7, check out the second in-depth training, which builds on the foundation you&#x27;ve built so far!
